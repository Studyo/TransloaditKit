# Roadmap

- [ ] Create an example app where TransloaditKit is used in (would show you how to use the client from a customerâ€™s point of view. Should help evolve the API)
- [ ] Allow picking files from Instagram through a Transloadit-hosted Uppy page that loads in a WebView
- [ ] Create a release blog post on transloadit.com with the changes from 2.x to 3.x and some usage examples.
- [ ] Update the code samples on transloadit.com (homepage, /demos, /docs) to reflect changes in 3.x
