# Roadmap

- [ ] Create an example app where TransloaditKit is used in (would show you how to use the client from a customerâ€™s point of view. Should help evolve the API)
   - [ ] Add ability to pause / resume uploads
   - [ ] Add progress bar for upload progress 
- [ ] Allow picking files from Instagram through a Transloadit-hosted Uppy page that loads in a WebView
- [ ] Create a release blog post on transloadit.com with the changes from 2.x to 3.x and some usage examples.
- [ ] Update the code samples on transloadit.com (homepage, /demos, /docs) to reflect changes in 3.x
- [ ] Add documentation (or link to it if it already exists)
- [ ] Add ability to upload without using the secret in the app
- [ ] Add ability to upload in background (iOS)
- [ ] Create a documentation describing the release process
- [ ] Implement more API endpoints (e.g. fetching assemblies, templates etc.)
- [ ] Add ability (or document it) to set fields, notify_url and allow_steps_override: https://transloadit.com/docs/api/assemblies-post/#param-fields
